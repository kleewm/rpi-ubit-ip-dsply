# rpi-ubit-ip-dsply
Getting the IP of a headless Raspberry Pi (RPI) is quite a challenge.  
This project makes use of an affordable BBC Micro:bit to display the IP of the RPI.  
On boot up, the RPI sends its IP to the Micro:bit via bluetooth.
Micro:bit code is found here: https://ukbaz.github.io/howto/ubit_workshop.html
